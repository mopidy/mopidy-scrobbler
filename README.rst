`Mopidy <https://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for scrobbling played tracks to
`Last.fm <https://www.last.fm/>`_.

This extension requires a free user account at Last.fm.


Installation
============

Install by running::

    pip install Mopidy-Scrobbler

Or, if available, install the Debian/Ubuntu package from `apt.mopidy.com
<https://apt.mopidy.com/>`_.


Configuration
=============

The extension is enabled by default when it is installed. You just need to add
your Last.fm username and password to your Mopidy configuration file, typically
found at ``~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf``::

    [scrobbler]
    username = alice
    password = secret
    scrobble_filer = list

The following configuration values are available:

- ``scrobbler/enabled``: If the scrobbler extension should be enabled or not.
- ``scrobbler/username``: Your Last.fm username.
- ``scrobbler/password``: Your Last.fm password.
- ``scrobbler/scrobble_filter``: List of uri schemes to not scrobble - eg spotify
